## Binary
---------
Binary is a number system with only 2 digits, 0 and 1. They are sometimes respectively refered to as "low" and "high" in digital data memory, storage, processing, and communications.

A binary digit, or "bit", is the smallest unit of data on a computer, where each bit can have a single value of either 0 or 1. Binary numbers, when written out, are similar to the base 10 system we are used to, however with base 2 instead. Each column represents a respective power of 2, starting from the right-most digit with a power 0.

| Number System | "Hundred thousands" | "Ten thousands" | "Thousands" | "Hundreds" | "Tens" | "Ones" |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Binary: base 2 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| Decimal: base 10 | 100000 | 10000 | 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 |

To convert from binary to decimal, simply add the "weight" of the digits with a 1 value.   
For example, 1010101 would be:


| 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | 0 | **1** | 0 | **1** | 0 | **1** |

And thus its decimal value would be 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = **85**.
