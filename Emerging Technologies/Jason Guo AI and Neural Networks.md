# AI and Neural Networks

Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often thought of as science fiction, a vicarious dream created by the delusional; however, almost all emerging technologies involve AI in some way. [Self driving cars](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-realistically-looks-like-2017-7), [voice recognition](https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-why-google-assistant-is-the-future-of-ai-11a07b64f981), and [facial recognition](https://www.techemergence.com/facial-recognition-applications/) are only some of the examples of AI technology.  

The future of mankind is inextricably tied to AI.

What is a Neural Network
---
Neural networks, at the most basic level, take in some input value(s), and return some output value(s). Whether it be an image, your voice, or some numbers and words, neural networks all aim to solve problems, most of which are usually done by people.   

Take the example of recognizing apples from oranges. It's understandably trivial to human beings, but to machines, this task would be much more difficult. Neural networks make these tasks, and many more, possible for computers to overcome.

Named and modeled after the human brain, neural networks use connected "neurons" to transmit information from input to output. Here is a diagram of an example neural network:

The input layer, of course, would be what goes into the neural network, and the output layer would be what comes out. Each of the layers in between the input and output layer is considered a "hidden layer", since what happens in those layers is unknown to users.

Each of the "neurons", or nodes, of a layer are connected to every node in the layer ahead. Information is transmitted from node to node, being manipulated each time, until finally the nodes reach the final layer and produce an output.

Societal Implications

Due to the near limitless functionality of AI and neural networks, society will inevitably undergo major changes in the upcoming years. Blue collar jobs can and will be automated, and thus many people will lose their source of income and be forced to find new work. Furthermore, the quality of life will be improved with newer technologies such as self-driving cars. As AI takes over everyday tasks such as driving, cleaning, or cooking, people may become entirely dependent on technology.

With AI taking over lower-level jobs, people will have more opportunities to get into business opportunities, and focus on pursuing their passion. The way of living as we know it will experience drastic change.

On the contrary, society may face new challenges with human rights as AI develops. Governments will have to implement new laws and regulations to ensure that AI is not intruding humanity's basic rights to privacy and information access.

Economic Implications
---

As mentioned previously, blue collar jobs will become obsolete as AI technology develops. The economy of the world will shift from a labour-based system to an information-based system and have the potential for massive growth.

According to some estimates, applications of AI has the potential to double economic growth rates, and improve human productivity by up to 40 percent ([source](https://www.techemergence.com/the-economic-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-an-interview-with-accentures-cto/)).

[There is an excellent infographic on the economic impacts of AI](http://www.businessinsider.com/infographic-ai-effect-on-economy-2017-8). It estimates that AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.

The following is an excerpt from the infographic:

Environmental Implications

The development of AI has both positive and negative effects on the environment. In many instances, AI can deal with environmental issues that are otherwise impossible to handle by humans. Machines armed with AI can take care of situations hazardous to humans. For example, [Japan has already created earthquake search-and-rescue robots](https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-03/six-robots-could-shape-future-earthquake-search-and-rescue). With AI developments into the future, these robots could become feasible to every situation - not just earthquakes.

The following image is of Japan's Robocue, the Tokyo fire department's rescue-'bot, practising for a rescue operation:

Many industries are integrated AI technology into their software systems. In [one oil company](http://new.abb.com/control-systems/industry-specific-solutions/oil-gas-and-petrochemicals/using-artificial-intelligence-to-reduce-environmental-impact), for example, AI is being used in their predictive emission software to identify key factors that cause harmful emissions. This software will be used to validate sensors that are responsible for harmful emissions, thus reducing the company's impact on the environment.

With the advent of self-driving car programs, the efficiency of transportation will be drastically increased. At the moment, [transportation is responsible for more than a quarter of greenhouse gas emmissions in the US](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions). By reducing the number of cars on roads, AI would be cutting down the harmful impacts of cars. However, as current vehicles become obsolete, there will be a surplus of waste as people switch to the newer, more efficient cars.
