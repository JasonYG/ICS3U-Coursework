Environmental Implications

> How can the combination of cartography and computer science help raise environmental awareness?

As more sophisticated means of cartography rise with the development of computer science, the general public will be more aware of the dangers of climate change, and the natural ecosystems that are most at risk. As our cartographic techniques become more complex, computer scientists will be able to model virtual environments that may not exist yet. In the current world, many people do not recognize the importance of protecting the environment; thus, when hypothetical environments are created, of a future world where we did not protect the environment, people will see how critical it is to protect the environment. As of now, protecting the environment is a "future" issue that many people do not see as an issue. Cartography will allow scientists to illustrate the adverse effects of climate change, and computer science allows for these complex models of the world to exist. Furthermore, computer scientists will be able to model the places on Earth that are most at risk. Many people, along with their disbelief of climate change, are never able to actually see why the environment needs to be protected. As computer science allows for more realistic renditions of our world to be created, people will see the beauty of the environment, and how we are destroying the natural habitats of many living creatures.

> How can the combination help the environment directly?

One direct impact of cartography and computer science is the reduction of physical waste. Since computer science allows for the digitalization of cartography, people will no longer need physical maps, and thus there would be less resources consumed, such as trees for paper. People will have access to realistic depictions of the world at their fingertips, perhaps in our smartphones or more advanced technologies. Along with a reduction in waste, the combination of cartography and computer science would have more subtle effects that are less drastic, but still very effective, in helping the environment. For example, sophisticated cartography technology would make the job of environmental scientists much easier. Instead of visiting an at-risk environment in person, cartography would allow the scientist to "visit" the ecosystem with software. This would make environmental protection work more efficient, effective, and less resource-intensive (time, money, fuel for travel, etc.).

Societal Implications

> How will cartography in video games change the way that societies interact in the future?

In the future where video games have extremely realistic worlds and natural environments, people will be more engrossed with gaming. Video games could play a much bigger role in people's lives, so much so that they can become more than just games. In pop culture, we often see the future of video games affecting people's interaction with one another. Society may adopt a new way of living: a real life, and a virtual life. However, depending on the prominence of video games, the virtual life may become real life. New laws would have to be created to hold people responsible for their actions in video games, since the environments would be so much more complex and real. Cartography will inevitably allow for more sophisticated video game environments, and worlds that rival our own. Knowing this, people may experience a drastic change in their lives as they gain a new way of living.

> How might cartography/computer science combination change societal views?

It is easier than ever to communicate with people from across the world; but, when we live on multiple worlds, our current technology will not suffice. Cartography, and its development through computer science, will allow for people to feel at home regardless of where they live. People will be able to "virtually" visit their friends and family at any time, and humanity will be more connected than ever. Furthermore, cartography may result in the reduction of stigma, specifically ethnocentrism. With different cultures and places in the universe being easier to experience, people would be less likely to discriminate against others, and we could become a more accepting society. 

> If you were living in these times, what would your day look like?

Since space travel would be easier, I may live on multiple planets within a short time frame. For example, I may have school on Mars, I may live on Venus, and my uncles may live on Jupiter. Regardless of where I may be, I would feel connected to people in the universe. Cartography would make my life easier with communication, and more interesting with video games. A day in my life may look like waking up in my home on Venus, then flying to school on Mars. During school, many of my classes may be in a digital environment (virtual field trips in biology, for instance), and I may be playing sophisticated video games in class. After school, I might visit my family on Jupiter, then hang out with my friends on Neptune. If I am really successful, I may even go on a date to Pluto: to the romantic corner of our universe, if I may. Finally, I would return home to Venus for dinner, and having done no work since homework has become obsolete due to computer science and cartography.

Economic Implications

> How can (code as) cartography help guide the destiny of the economy?

As cartography becomes more and more developed, the technology, specifically code as cartography, will shape our economy from a labour-based system to a technology- and information-based system. As mentioned in the "Code as Cartography" article, "in a world awash with data and with powerful computers that fit in the palm of your hand, the demand for relevant information displays has neer been greater" (source 2). Thus, as the demand for cartography increases, there will be a rise in career options for computer scientists and programmers to code these maps: as they are not "static images", but "source code that renders in a web browser". Traditional cartographer jobs will be rendered obsolete as the occupation becomes digitalized. Along with an increase in careers in technology, code as cartography might have indirect implications on our economy that are still significant. For example, if maps become easier to access and more interactive, then jobs that involve maps, such as environmental scientists, will become easier. Thus, there will be a rise in these jobs as code as cartography becomes more prominent. With these newly created jobs, the economy will see a rise in the technology, environmental, and other industries that are affected by cartography developments. 

> How might cartography in video games change the current "way we do business"

In the future, video games will have artificial environments, and entire worlds facilitated by cartography technology. As mentioned in the article "The Impact of 1980s and 1990s Video Games on Multimedia Cartography", "The technical options provided by modern software were playfully explored - 'they look cool' [. . .] and have a 'gee whiz factor'" (source 1). If cartography technology and games that were created almost 30 years ago managed to elicit such a reaction in people, then it is obvious that future developments in video game cartography will engross the general population, and change the "way we do business". If video games become an integral part of peoples' lives, more so than they are today, there will be a rise in the demand for video games. This would mean that our entire society, let alone the economy, could shift to a virtual-based system. All transactions, interaction, and business could be conducted in video games once the cartography technology becomes more sophisticated. After all, if the digital world becomes as realistic as the real world, then there would no longer be a strictly "real" world.

> What jobs would exist? What would change? What does it look like to have a job/career in this time? Would cartography (either "Code as" or within video games) have an effect on the careers that would exist? If so, why? How? What technological jobs would exist?

In a future where enhanced space travel and interplanetary living are ubiquitous, new jobs would rise with the importance of cartography. Humanity will need detailed renditions of multiply worlds, and thus cartography would become more important than ever. Computer scientists and programmers working in cartography would become a huge career path, and other more labour-based jobs would disappear as technology progresses. Automation would eliminate jobs that used to be done by humans, such as factory and manufacturing work, and the economy would be drastically changed. Jobs in this era would either directly involve technology or use technology in some way. Specifically, if cartography technology develops enough, then most, if not all, jobs will use the technology. A doctor, for example, might use a detailed map of a patient's house to see environmental risks; a lawyer might use a depiction of a crime scene as evidence in court; or an astronaut might look at a digitalzied version of home while exploring the universe. Some examples of technological jobs include computer scientists that research cartography and virtual world building, engineers that incorporate cartography into technologies related to space travel, and graphic designers that help create these virtual worlds.

Postsecondary Opportunities

> What schooling requirements do you believe would be required to participate in a society based on having full access to cartography (either "Code as" or within video games) possibilities?

Ideally, there would be no formal schooling requirements to use cartography as researchers would make the technology consumer friendly, such that anyone with a basic understanding of maps could use it. The original Super Mario games, for example, created maps that were "user-friendly and suitable for children" (source 1). The ordinary person, whether they be an elder or a child, should be able to use the technology. However, to work with cartography or to have a deeper understanding would require a more formal education, perhaps a university degree. A researcher developing digital maps, for example, might need a degree in computer science to understand the limits of software technology and what we can do to create these maps. Somebody working the mechanics of cartography, rather than the programming aspect, might need a degree analagous to a geography degree to understand map creation and world building. The technologies involving cartography might be difficult to understand and develop, but the technology should be accessible by everyone.

> What technology would exist to help you with your education?

Specifically with cartography, complex maps and renditions of multiple worlds would help with many aspects of education. In courses such as geography, or even history, cartography would allow students to explore parts of the world or history that are inaccessible. Digital field trips facilitated by developments in technology, in the comforts of a classroom. This would allow for more hands-on, participant learning, as students will be able to contextualize the learning done in the classroom and see the real world applications of what they are learning. In a different course such as biology, a class could "explore" virtual environments and ecosystems to see and experiment with the intricacies of the environment: what would happen if there were too many predators? plants? rabbits? what if we moved a polar bear to Mars? Students will be able to use their creativity to enhance their learning, and use these cartographic technologies for their benefit. Education would become both much more engaging, and much more meaningful.
