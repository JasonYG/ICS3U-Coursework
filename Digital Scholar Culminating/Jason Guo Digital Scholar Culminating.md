> How can the combination of cartography and computer science help raise environmental awareness?
As more sophisticated means of cartography rise with the development of computer science, the general public will be more aware of the dangers of climate change, and the natural ecosystems that are most at risk. As our cartographic techniques become more complex, computer scientists will be able to model virtual environments that may not exist yet. In the current world, many people do not recognize the importance of protecting the environment; thus, when hypothetical environments are created, of a future world where we did not protect the environment, people will see how critical it is to protect the environment. As of now, protecting the environment is a "future" issue that many people do not see as an issue. Cartography will allow scientists to illustrate the adverse effects of climate change, and computer science allows for these complex models of the world to exist. Furthermore, computer scientists will be able to model the places on Earth that are most at risk. Many people, along with their disbelief of climate change, are never able to actually see why the environment needs to be protected. As computer science allows for more realistic renditions of our world to be created, people will see the beauty of the environment, and how we are destroying the natural habitats of many living creatures.

> How can the combination help the environment directly?
One direct impact of cartography and computer science is the reduction of physical waste. Since computer science allows for the digitalization of cartography, people will no longer need physical maps, and thus there would be less resources consumed, such as trees for paper. People will have access to realistic depictions of the world at their fingertips, perhaps in our smartphones or more advanced technologies. Along with a reduction in waste, the combination of cartography and computer science would have more subtle effects that are less drastic, but still very effective, in helping the environment. For example, sophisticated cartography technology would make the job of environmental scientists much easier. Instead of visiting an at-risk environment in person, cartography would allow the scientist to "visit" the ecosystem with software. This would make environmental protection work more efficient, effective, and less resource-intensive (time, money, fuel for travel, etc.).

Societal Implications
-------
> How will cartography in video games change the way that societies interact in the future?

Envision life in 200 years where we have enhanced space travel and now live upon multiple planets.

> How might cartography/computer science combination change societal views?
> If you were living in these times, what would your day look like?

Economic Implications
-------
Envision life in 200 years (as per societal question above)

>How can (code as) cartography help guide the destiny of the economy?
>How might cartography in video games change the current "way we do business"

Employment Implications
-------
Envision life in 200 years (as per societal question above)

>What jobs would exist?
>What would change?
>What does it look like to have a job/career in this time?
>Would cartography (either "Code as" or within video games) have an effect on the careers that would exist? If so, why? How?
>What technological jobs would exist?

Postsecondary Opportunities
-------
Envision life in 200 years (as per societal question above)

>What schooling requirements do you believe would be required to participate in a society based on having full access to cartography (either "Code as" or within video games) possibilities?
>What technology would exist to help you with your education?
