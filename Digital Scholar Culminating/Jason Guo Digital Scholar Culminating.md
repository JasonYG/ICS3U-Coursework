> How can the combination of cartography and computer science help raise environmental awareness?

As more sophisticated means of cartography rise with the development of computer science, the general public will be more aware of the dangers of climate change, and the natural ecosystems that are most at risk. As our cartographic techniques become more complex, computer scientists will be able to model virtual environments that may not exist yet. In the current world, many people do not recognize the importance of protecting the environment; thus, when hypothetical environments are created, of a future world where we did not protect the environment, people will see how critical it is to protect the environment. As of now, protecting the environment is a "future" issue that many people do not see as an issue. Cartography will allow scientists to illustrate the adverse effects of climate change, and computer science allows for these complex models of the world to exist. Furthermore, computer scientists will be able to model the places on Earth that are most at risk. Many people, along with their disbelief of climate change, are never able to actually see why the environment needs to be protected. As computer science allows for more realistic renditions of our world to be created, people will see the beauty of the environment, and how we are destroying the natural habitats of many living creatures.

> How can the combination help the environment directly?

One direct impact of cartography and computer science is the reduction of physical waste. Since computer science allows for the digitalization of cartography, people will no longer need physical maps, and thus there would be less resources consumed, such as trees for paper. People will have access to realistic depictions of the world at their fingertips, perhaps in our smartphones or more advanced technologies. Along with a reduction in waste, the combination of cartography and computer science would have more subtle effects that are less drastic, but still very effective, in helping the environment. For example, sophisticated cartography technology would make the job of environmental scientists much easier. Instead of visiting an at-risk environment in person, cartography would allow the scientist to "visit" the ecosystem with software. This would make environmental protection work more efficient, effective, and less resource-intensive (time, money, fuel for travel, etc.).

Societal Implications
-------
> How will cartography in video games change the way that societies interact in the future?

In the future where video games have extremely realistic worlds and natural environments, people will be more engrossed with gaming. Video games could play a much bigger role in people's lives, so much so that they can become more than just games. In pop culture, we often see the future of video games affecting people's interaction with one another. Society may adopt a new way of living: a real life, and a virtual life. However, depending on the prominence of video games, the virtual life may become real life. New laws would have to be created to hold people responsible for their actions in video games, since the environments would be so much more complex and real. Cartography will inevitably allow for more sophisticated video game environments, and worlds that rival our own. Knowing this, people may experience a drastic change in their lives as they gain a new way of living.

> How might cartography/computer science combination change societal views?

It is easier than ever to communicate with people from across the world; but, when we live on multiple worlds, our current technology will not suffice. Cartography, and its development through computer science, will allow for people to feel at home regardless of where they live. People will be able to "virtually" visit their friends and family at any time, and humanity will be more connected than ever. Furthermore, cartography may result in the reduction of stigma, specifically ethnocentrism. With different cultures and places in the universe being easier to experience, people would be less likely to discriminate against others, and we could become a more accepting society. 

> If you were living in these times, what would your day look like?

Since space travel would be easier, I may live on multiple planets within a short time frame. For example, I may have school on Mars, I may live on Venus, and my uncles may live on Jupiter. Regardless of where I may be, I would feel connected to people in the universe. Cartography would make my life easier with communication, and more interesting with video games. A day in my life may look like waking up in my home on Venus, then flying to school on Mars. During school, many of my classes may be in a digital environment (virtual field trips in biology, for instance), and I may be playing sophisticated video games in class. After school, I might visit my family on Jupiter, then hang out with my friends on Neptune. If I am really successful, I may even go on a date to Pluto: to the romantic corner of our universe, if I may. Finally, I would return home to Venus for dinner, and having done no work since homework has become obsolete due to computer science and cartography.

Economic Implications

Envision life in 200 years (as per societal question above)

> How can (code as) cartography help guide the destiny of the economy?
> How might cartography in video games change the current "way we do business"

Employment Implications
-------
Envision life in 200 years (as per societal question above)

> What jobs would exist?
> What would change?
> What does it look like to have a job/career in this time?
> Would cartography (either "Code as" or within video games) have an effect on the careers that would exist? If so, why? How?
> What technological jobs would exist?
