Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often thought of as science fiction, a vicarious dream created by the delusional; however, almost all emerging technologies involve AI in some way. [Self driving cars](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-the-future-of-self-driving-cars-realistically-looks-like-2017-7), [voice recognition](https://medium.com/swlh/5-reasons-why-google-assistant-is-the-future-of-ai-11a07b64f981), and facial recognition are only some of the examples of AI technology.  

The future of mankind is inextricably tied to AI.
